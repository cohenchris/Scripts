## Arch

My main [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) system.


## OpenWRT

[OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/) is a open-source linux router OS.
I personally run it in ["dumb AP" mode](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/network/wifi/wifiextenders/bridgedap) and have flashed it on an enterprise [Netgear WAX220 AP](https://www.netgear.com/business/wifi/access-points/wax220/).


## OPNSense
[`opnsense`](opnsense/)

[OPNSense](https://opnsense.org/) is an open-source FreeBSD router OS.
I use this OS as my network's main router, flashed on a [Protectli VP2420 Router](https://protectli.com/product/vp2420/).
